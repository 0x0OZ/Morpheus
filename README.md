# OOFNode
00FNode's a simple, lightweight and easy to use open source node to use with the Open Oracle Framework to automate feed submission for onchain oracles and provide feeds, using a google spreadsheet for collaborative and transparent queries and making feed management easy for users. The node is simple to setup and will run autonomously, pulling from APIs in the spreadsheet and submitting the transactions to update the onchain feeds for any network via customizable RPC.
